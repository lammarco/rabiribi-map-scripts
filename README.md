Rabi-Ribi Randomizer Search

A python script to help players find progression items and eggs during randomizers (considered cheating if used in a race).

Download:

-Download both rbrb_locations.db and rbrb_rando_search.py

-Put both into a safe place, probably the parent directory above the map files.

-Update the directorys at the top of the script as needed

--(the default has the script in the same directory as rbrb_locations.db and the folder s2_editable_maps that contains the jsons)

How to use:

-Run rbrb_rando_search.py like any other Python3 script

-There will be input prompts, for things such as which maps to load and what to search for
